Code book:

The R script creates two data objects, named as "data_frame" and "tidy_data". "Data_frame" merges all the measured data, subject and activity identifiers and measurement labels to a data frame. The data frame contains both test and train data. Subjects are identified with variable "Person_id" and activities with variable "Activity". Numerical acitivity labels are labelled with descriptions of the activity as given in the file "activity_labels.txt" in the original data source. Measures are labeled as in  "features.txt" file in the original data source. There are no any data transformations is the "data_frame" object.

Object "tidy_data" summarizes data in "data_set" be giving mean of each measured variable by each individual-activity combination. The data is in wide form with each row corresponig to a individual-activity combination. Variables are named as in "data_set" object: Subjects and actitivies are assigned with variables "Person_id" and "Activity", respectively. Means of the measured variables are given with variables named after corresponding measure. They are calculated as mean of a measure for given subject and activity (for example, subject 1 and activity "Standing").
